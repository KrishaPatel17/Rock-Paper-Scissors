Simple rock,paper,scissors game. When using code please write in lowercase letters only. If you see any issues please tell me, otherwise thank you for playing!

To-do:
- Find out how to make it so player_2 cant see what player_1's choice was

Log:
- 10/15 Randomized opponents option
- 10/22 Point couting 
- 10/22 Code will now stop after 3 rounds unless you choose 'yes' to play again.
- 10/23 Added a 'random' option for the player.
- 10/28 Added multiplayer, but with the issue of player 2 always winning.
